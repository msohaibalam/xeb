# (Quantum) Cross-Entropy Benchmark Fidelity
Simulating quantum supremacy benchmarking with random unitary sampling.

This repo collects and demos the code discussed in the blog post [`Unpacking the Quantum Supremacy Benchmark withÂ Python`](https://medium.com/@sohaib.alam/unpacking-the-quantum-supremacy-benchmark-with-python-67a46709d)
 by [M. Sohaib Alam](https://github.com/msohaibalam) and [Will Zeng](https://github.com/willzeng). To view the output of the computations discussed in the blog, you can
 - Run the jupyter notebook `xeb_calcs.ipynb`, or
 - Execute `python xeb.py` from a terminal shell.

A small appendix is available in `xeb_post_appendix.pdf`, and outlines the derivation for the theoretical values of the benchmark fidelity used in the blog post.
